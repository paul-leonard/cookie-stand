### About Paul Leonard

#### Summary of Website
This is a website for a fictional company called Pat's Salmon Cookie Company.  The premise is to have two webpages.  One will be the front facing public site that offers company information and promotes the product.  The second will be a webpage that calculates and displays sales information for internal use.

The underlying intent of this website is to practice creating a website that requires HTML, CSS, and JS.  The main new subjects being introduced during Lab06 are objects and their use.

## About Me (within a README for a website about me)
Thank you for visiting my page of notes.  I hope they were helpful to you.  Please also check out [my GitHub portfolio page](https://github.com/paul-leonard "Paul's GitHub Portfolio").

After graduating with a mechanical engineering degree from *Missouri University of Science and Technology* 13 years ago, I moved out to Seattle and started work at Boeing.  While there, I worked in airplane modifications, flight test, and flight controls design engineering.  I am super excited to return to a rich learning environment and gain some new programming skills.  I plan to complete the full course path ending with a specialty in Python.  I enjoy spending time outside by camping and hiking or having a beer at a brewery with friends (when that is a thing again).
